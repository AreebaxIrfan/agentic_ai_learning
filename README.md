# 🤖 Agentic AI Learning Lab  
**Building Real-World AI Agents with `agentic-ai-sdk`, Chainlit & UV**

This repository showcases the practical side of Agentic AI by building intelligent, purpose-driven agents to solve real-world problems. Using the power of the [`agentic-ai-sdk`](https://github.com/agentic-ai/agentic), [`Chainlit`](https://docs.chainlit.io/), and the blazing-fast [`UV`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager, we've crafted a custom GPT-like agent focused on solving a single, specific task — reflecting the true spirit of focused autonomy.
